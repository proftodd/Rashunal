# Rashunal

C implementation of basic integer arithmetic

To install (after cloning):
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ make ..
$ make && make test
```
If you like what you see,
`sudo make install`

I've only tested the build, compilation, testing, and installation on my Mac. CMake is supposed to be cross-platform, but YMMV.
